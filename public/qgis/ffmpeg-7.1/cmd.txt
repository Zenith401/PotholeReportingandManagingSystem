AFTER BUILDING FFMPEG FROM SOURCE WE CAN RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND

./ffmpeg -i ../GX010018.MP4 -vf fps=1 ../GX_thumbnails_test1/out%d.png
	    //DIR OF VIDEO            //THUMBNAIL DIR

This command creates a thumbnail for each second in the video
For example our file above is 17.XX secs long so we have 18 screenshots 
1 -> 0 sec
18 -> 17 sec

WE WILL NEED TO VERIFY THIS WITH OTHER VIDEO FORMATS TO ENSURE WHEN A CUSTOMER UPLOADS THEY HAVE NO ISSUES
WETHER THEY UPLOAD WITH A GOPRO, IPHONE, or ANDROID
